This is the repo to accompany the [walkthrough](http://trendct.github.io/weather/temperatures.html) for the TrendCT story: [How hot has it been in Connecticut this summer](http://www.trendct.org)?

These visualizations would not have been possible without the excellent work from Bradley Boehmke's [Dayton's Weather in 2014](https://rpubs.com/bradleyboehmke/weather_graphic) and Randy Olson's [The New York Times weather chart redux](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/08/13/the-new-york-times-weather-chart-redux/).

The data is from the [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com).
